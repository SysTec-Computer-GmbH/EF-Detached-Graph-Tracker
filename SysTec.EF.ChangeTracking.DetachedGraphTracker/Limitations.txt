1. new() initializer for properties may only be used on collection types
2. Owned collections are not supported
3. Only int keys are supported. This behavior also translates to composite keys.
4. Handling of db-generated values is limited to npgsql databases.
5. Required relationship cannot be severed from the dependent side because:
   - The foreign key is not nullable, thus setting the navigation to null is a contradiction.
   - Severing the relationship would result in deleting the dependent, which also can be achieved by directly deleting the dependent.
6. Only one composition node with the same key(s) and type is allowed per graph. Otherwise an exception is thrown.
7. The [ForceDelete] functionality is limited to collection navigations
8. [ForceUnchanged] on collection navigations only prevents relationships to be severed. New relationships can still be added.
9. All attributes must be set on a concrete navigation property. Attributes on abstract properties are ignored.

Notes:
1. If a node is annotated with a [UpdateAssociationOnly] NOTHING in the subtree can be changed (including relationships)
